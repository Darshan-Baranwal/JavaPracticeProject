Solution - wait, notify and notifyAll

These methods are used to manage some monitor lock situations to prevent thread from blocking indefinitely.
These methods are on Object thus any instance of class can execute these methods from within a synchronized method
or statement.

wait(timeout) -> Causes the current thread to wait until it is awakened typically notified or interrupted or until
a certain amount of real time has elapsed.

notify() -> wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this Objects monitor lock. The choice which thread will be
awakened is arbitrary.

notifyAll() - wakes up all thread waiting on this object's monitor. This method only be called by a thread
that is the owner of this object's monitor.

wait, notify, notifyAll must be applied inside synchronized block or method having intrinsic lock.
