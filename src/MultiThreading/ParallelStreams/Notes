Data parallelism
Automatic workload distribution among threads.
Improved performance on multi core CPUs.
Parallel streams requires lots of under the hood items need to be taken care, like managing threads,
synchronization, memory management etc.
When to use parallel streams -
 To make array sorted in parallel processing, first sort the Stream at source then apply parallel stream intermediate
 operation and then use forEachOrdered

 Use Collectors.joining(" ") -> when joining string in parallel env

Concurrent collections is more preferred against Collections.synchronized collections, because synchronised collections are Blocking and works on locks
and concurrent collections use non blocking algorithms to enable safe concurrent access without the need for heavy handed locking.
