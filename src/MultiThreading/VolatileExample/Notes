volatile modifier is an indicator telling the variable value may be changes
by multiple threads
So whenever change in that variable occur, threads local cache immediately
push the current value to change other threads cache. To accomplish this,
volatile modifier ensures that the variable is always read from and written
to the main memory rather than from any thread specific caches.

It doesn't guarantee Atomicity(all changes either successful or abort)

It should be used for boolean or counters where Atomicity is not mandatory.
