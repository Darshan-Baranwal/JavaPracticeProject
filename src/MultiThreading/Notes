Thread class has two constructors -
1. new Thread() -> used to create thread by subclass extending thread class
2. new Thread(Runnable runnable) -> used to create the thread object with class implementing Runnable interface

extending thread method might create Diamond problem as Class extend only one class in Java.

using Thread constructor with Runnable object as parameter we can pass lambda expression as .run() implementation
because Runnable interface is a Functional Interface.

Atomic and immutable objects are thread safe.
