Starvation Thread problem occur when thread is unable to obtain the resource it needs, to execute.
This is usually caused by the other concurrent thread being greedy.
Some threads are able to make progress others can't.
This means your application may still keep running and some of the work is getting done. but not all of it.
Starvation can fixed with Fairness of locks.
Monitor/implicit locks are unfair lock - it complete depend on cores who will get the thread
but Explicit locks like Reentrant lock can be Unfair and Fair.
Fair lock makes sure that the lock will distributed to other threads as well.
